    - **Key Events**: Major plot points, discoveries, and decisions
    - **Combat Encounters**: Brief summaries of any battles
    - **NPC Interactions**: Notable conversations and new NPCs met
    - **Character Moments**: Memorable roleplaying or character development
    - **Loot & Rewards**: Items found, gold earned, etc.
    - **Cliffhangers & Hooks**: Unresolved plot threads for next session
    
    Write in a narrative style that captures the adventure's tone.
    Use the speaker names provided to attribute actions and dialogue.
